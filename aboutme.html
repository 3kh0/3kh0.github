    <h2>About Echo</h2>
<p>Wait, people want to know stuff about me? Well ok. To my family, I am the official tech support. 
  Have a problem? Ask me! I started coding when I was 6. 
  I was still using block coding at the time but I have taken a greater interest in actual coding. 
  I am talking about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
  I wanted to learn more so I went to the god almighty google and searched for coding courses. 
  I never took any kid coding classes because they were still doing block coding. 
  I bought a big CSS book that is about 500 pages. I spent a whole week reading and studying. 
  Still, I suck at it. If anyone knows CSS please DM me on discord so I can make my site look a little better. <p></p>
  Then I got access to my dad's computer. It was a fairly new iMac. Before I was using an old MacBook air that whenever I opened up Visual Studio Code, the fans would go crazy. 
  The iMac could run many programs at once without triggering the fans. 
  I was just coding random scripts and did not release them because they were buggy as heck. 
  Then I got into GitHub. I put some of my projects up there. 
  I started working to host all of my projects on GitHub. It was a very plain site. On the homepage, it only had 3 links to projects. 
  I started adding games to the site and other fun stuff I made. 
  I applied for advertising on my site and within 4 days it got approved. 
  I wanted to earn money but not have ads everywhere. I earn about 24 cents every day from advertising. 
   I am still working on all sorts of projects.</p>
 <b>Stay tuned!</b><br>
